What combat style do we want?

- Chrono Trigger style: requires a lot more work to set up each encounter; no random encounters
- FF style: gives random encounters; no need to worry about sensible placement; might require background images for each zone
- mixed: enemies appear on the map but you can avoid them
  * patrol routes require some extra work
  * could do a proximity thing?
  * could do world map has random encounters, cities only have triggered encounters

Turn-based combat for simplicity.

How do I handle stealth in combat?
- stealth impacts enemy miss chance
- can skip enemy turns sometimes
  * need to use stealth action?
- can give an extra surprise round
